# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance between two points.

## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Get the two list forom the user

### Step 2: 
import the math module

### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula ![formula](https://github.com/Naveensrinivasan07/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/119475891/61026b6e-d09c-41a1-80ed-e6b81ea24f63)


### Step 4: 
print the value useing the format function

### Step 5: 
Stop the program

### PROGRAM:
```python
#Program to find the distance between two points.

#RegisterNumber: 212222240070
import math
l1=(4,2)
l2=(10,6)
distance=math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print(round(distance,2))
```
### OUTPUT:
![OUTPUT 1](https://github.com/Naveensrinivasan07/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/119475891/6174b2b5-d2ad-4664-9a59-807497f1e568)
### RESULT:
Thus the program to find the distance between two points is written and verified using python programming
